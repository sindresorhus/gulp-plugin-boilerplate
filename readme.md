# gulp-plugin-boilerplate

> Boilerplate to kickstart creating [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) plugins

Contains all the current best-practices.

## Getting started

In your directory, run:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-plugin-boilerplate/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components 1 && mv _package.json package.json && mv _readme.md readme.md
```

You can also `git clone` or [download](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-plugin-boilerplate/archive/main.zip) this repo, but then you'll have to rename `_readme.md` to `readme.md` and `_package.json` to `package.json`.

There's also a [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/sindresorhus/generator-gulp-plugin-boilerplate).
